Command Line CMS

A command line content management system designed to allow an employer to track, update and delete information about their workplace.

Using three broad categories, employees, departments and roles, this CMS uses the Inquirer package to solicit prompts, requests, selections and entries from a user, that will allow them to interact with their data in a variety of ways.

I especially paid attention to soliciting confirmations from a user before making any permanent changes to the database, like updates or deletions.

to run: 
node app.js
